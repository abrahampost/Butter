# Butter

Goal is to implement a toy programming language in Go

## Current features
* Can evaluate arbitrary arithmetic expressions
* Boolean logic implemented
* Print statementes

Lots of features and improvements coming in the next few weeks.

## Things coming soon
* Variables
* Flow control
* More complex data types (currently only has bool and integer
* Unit tests

# To use
* Make sure you have go installed
* `go build <all .go files in directory>`
* `main.exe [file_name]`
  * If no file name provided will start REPL
  * will definitely streamline this process as infrastructure gets completed
