# Butter

Goal is to implement a toy programming language in Go

## Current features
* Can evaluate arbitrary arithmetic expressions
* String literals, integers, floats, booleans
* Boolean logic implemented
* Print statements
* Implicitly typed variables
 * can assign with `<var_name> := <expr>`


Lots of features and improvements coming in the next few weeks.

## Things coming soon
* Flow control
* More complex data types (currently only has bool and integer
* Unit tests

# To use
* Make sure you have go installed
* `go build` in home directory
* `Butter.exe [file_name]`
  * If no file name provided will start REPL
  * will definitely streamline this process as infrastructure gets completed
